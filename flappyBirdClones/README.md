## Flappy Bird Clones
*A fun way to facilitate Project Based Learning in an online learning environment due to COVID-19.*

## Purpose
- Develop a complete Flappy Bird clone written in **p5.js** as part of **Project Based Learning** for **ABA Class of 2020**.
- Document my weeky progress in a 'Coding Journal' on my personal [Github Page](https://mvpoirier.github.io/).
