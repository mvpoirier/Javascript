## Flappy Bird Clones
*A fun way to facilitate Project Based Learning in an online learning environment due to COVID-19.*

## Aim
- Provide an engaging and online **Project Based Learning (PBL)** task for **ABA Class of 2020**.
- Develop a complete **Flappy Bird Clone** written in **Javascipt** using the **p5.js** framework. 
- Document my weeky progress in a 'Coding Journal' on my personal [Github Page](https://mvpoirier.github.io/).

## Flappy Bird Clone
- Inspired by [Gravity Game](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_gravity.asp), written in pure Javascript.
- My version is based on [Coding Train Challenge #31: Flappy Bird Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgA1d_E-jY).

## Progress
- As of April 20, 2020 completed a fully functional Flappy Bird Clone (WEEK 3).
